# DenseFusionRGB

This repo proposes an adaptation of the DenseFusion method from [DenseFusion](https://sites.google.com/view/densefusion), to make 6D POse Estimation from RGB images only.
The code is an adaptation from the implementation of DenseFusion available [here](https://github.com/j96w/DenseFusion)

All details about the method can be found in **supports/Project_Report.pdf**.
